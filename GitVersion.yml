# ContinuousDeployment forces the build number to be incremented by 1 for every commit that comes after the
# most recent tag version.
mode: ContinuousDeployment

# When a version is created by a single commit, it will contain this suffix and an auto incremented build number.
# Example: 1.1.7897-alpha0001
# When a version is created by creating a tag/release, it will NOT contain this suffix.
# Example: 1.1.7897
